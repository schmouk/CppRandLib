This is the c++20 part of library **CppRandLib**.

It uses modules and constraints, for instance, as well as new 
`generate` and `transform` algorithms.

See directory `c++11` to get access an older way of implementing 
**CppRandLib**.

Please notice that documentation is embedded in each header file 
and conforms to doxygen syntax.
